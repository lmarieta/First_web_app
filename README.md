Basic web app to test development with Ruby on Rails and CSS. You can use the different buttons to edit what you see in the app.

To start, you can run bin/rails server or bin/dev for dev environment (CSS updated in real time) in the terminal. Make it visible to other on the same network with rails server -b IP_ADDRESS. IP_ADDRESS can be found with ipconfig of ifconfig (on linux). Open a browser and access your page with http://IP_ADDRESS:3000. Note that the port number (5000) might change and could be specified when starting the server.
